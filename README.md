# AniMover

Small tool to automatically move files matching a certain pattern over to another folder, while also renaming. Allows 
for the configuration of simple rules, like increasing/decreasing a matched number when renaming files.

## TODO

  - Log renames into file (old name -> new name)
  - Allow other regex's to be used for matching
  - Offer Web page to add/remove jobs
  - Support expiry dates for jobs
  - Create Docker image
